Today in IT Mr. Keen gave us our briefing and then hhad to leave early because of something umportant. I started at 28% and I then ended at 33%. I fiinised off pyglatin and I started on functions today. I found pyglatin hard because there were lots of things to remember and there were alsoa lot f phrases to remember as well.
