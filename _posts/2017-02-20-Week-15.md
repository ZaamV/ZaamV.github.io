Today in It we worked on Codecademy again. I started on 14% and I ended at 19%. I was really stuck at the beginning and I finally worked out how to do it after a few times of different possibilities. After that exercise I managed to do quite a few more without thinking because it was getting really easy and I was actually getting used to it. I focused on boolean today and I would say that it is the easiest part of the python project so far.
