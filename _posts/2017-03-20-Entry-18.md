Today in IT it was one of my hardest lessons so far. I found my exercises very hard and very challenging. I started the lesson on 28% and ended on 30%. Also I needed to use the hint a few times because of how challenging it was. I tried and tried and eventually I got through some more exercises. Mr Keen then gave us a talk about why we shoukd do coding at home which I will now do.
