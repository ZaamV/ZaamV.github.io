    <td>We followed the instructions from the notebook and we did as much as we could. Whenever we got something wrong we tried and tried again until we did it right. We then copied it onto our pen drive.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was very lazy whilst we were setting up the Fuze Boxes and all I did was get the instruction book out. I need to make sure I try harder but I did do a lot to do with the coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try and do a bit more in the lesson and try and cover a bit more from the instructions manual. Also I will try and do it a bit quicker so I have less homework to do at home.</td>
