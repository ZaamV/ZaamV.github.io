Today in IT we looked at the problem with cheating. Mr Keen gathered us round and told us a very inspiring lecture about why we shouldn't cheat. He said " We should never cheat because it doesn’t help us to learn and it can cause many problems when we are older. Also he told us not to tell our friends any answers so they don’t suffer from anything that doesn’t help them when they are older too.
